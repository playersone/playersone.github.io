> "THE BEST solitaire app. Believe me, I've tried them all so you don't have to. The ads are minimal, they really didn't bother me, but I paid to remove them to support the company."

> "It's solitaire, what more can you say? The UI is sleek and it isn't bogged down by extra modes or complexities. I appreciate the inclusion of "hints" - which gives you a hidden card if you get stuck with no other options - but I honestly enjoying building them up more than spending them."
